# Recommended Plugins

## Community plugins

At first I fell in love with all the obsidian plugins, I am who doesn't? One of the amazing benefits of obsidian is to have such a huge range of plugins offered by a strong, contributing community.

I think I peaked at ~40 plugins, which now sounds way too much for me because I realized that the more plugins I have, the heavier the vault becomes, and the more it is dependent on plugins that might be deleted or incompatible in the future.

That's when I simplified my workflow, and narrowed it down to ~20 plugins, of which I believe 9 are game changers for every PKM user:

1. **Dataview** - The ability to query your notes, to get dynamic list of notes which constantly updates based on custom filters. For example, "show me all the notes that I've written in the last week", or more advanced like "Show me all the books with X tag and a custom field status of y". This plugin turns your vault from a simple word processor to an intelligent knowledge management system. [Documentation](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
2. **Templater** - Without it, my vault couldn't grow, because each new note would have been so cumbersome to create because of all the custom field I would have to fill in by hand each time. The flexibility of this plugin to create custom templates is absolutely phenomenal. [Documentation](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html)
3. **Tasks** - enables you to create, query and adjust tasks better than any task management tool that exists out there [Documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction)
4. **Linter** - "cleans" up the formatting of your notes based on certain rules. While it doesn't "add" anything to my knowledge, it certainly makes it more pretty and readable
5. **Commander** - The ability to hide and add commands as custom buttons on obsidian's UI (in case using the command palette is inconvenient)
6. **Excalidraw** - Creating visual sketches to go along with your notes increases knowledge retainment, and it is surprisingly fun, and trust me, I'm bad at drawings and yet this is the most enjoyable part of my workflow. 
7. **Smart connections** - It uses local LLM models to offer potential relations between notes. This strengthens your ability to find connections that you never thought about. 
8. **Style settings** - Customize how obsidian looks as much as you like for your convenience
9. **Metadata menu** - A convenient way of updating, adding and managing note properties + autocomplete while writing

Don't forget to turn off restricted mode to use community plugins.

In order for this vault to function properly, it comes with 5 plugins: dataview, templater, commander, tasks and metadata menu, but I do recommend installing the others as well.

## Core plugins

Obsidian comes with a full set of core plugins, some more useful than others. Go through the core plugin list and see what's relevant. The less you use, the faster + more stable your workflow will be. Also consider duplications, for example if you use the templater plugin, you don't need the "templates" plugin.

## Themes

This is really a matter of personal taste, but it might be nice to personalize obsidian with a custom theme. Themes allow you to change text/heading styles, UI colors, and other visual improvements. My favorite is AnuPpuccin

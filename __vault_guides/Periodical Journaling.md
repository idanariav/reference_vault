# Periodical Journaling

There are many different ways to examine your life and to document it. That is why I follow the [[IDEA system]], which uses different time frames (day, week, month, quarter, year) to look at your life from a different angle/level of zoom.

Also, the journaling habits is combined with the [[Task Management]] aspect of the vault, so you'll see both compo

## **Daily**

Reflect on the day's events and how you acted in them. At first I used a base "rate" to rate my day, but then I realized how narrow it is. A single measure, especially a numeric one can't represent the richness and complexity of human life. That's why I added both qualitative measures (an empty text field to enter your thoughts about the day), and quantitative measures (metrics you can track across time).

example metrics:
1. Forgiveness (text) - What do you forgive yourself for doing or not doing today? To let go of shame, blame or fear
2. Awe (text) - What have you seen today that excited you? A touching experience, something that has moved you
3. MinimalProgress (text) - What would make you feel that "at least this day wasn't a waste", something as small as a few minutes that can create a feeling of progress
4. Gratitude (text) - something you are grateful for
5. Kindness (text) - an act of kindness you've done for someone else without expecting return
6. Openness (text) - a verbal expression of care or gratitude towards someone else, to share part of yourself with someone else
7. Documentation (True/False) - Have you been journaling today?
8. Health (True/False) - Do you feel well today?
9. AvoidedTemptations (True/False) - Did you manage to avoid temptations such as social media and unhealthy food today?
10. UpheldCommitments (True/False) - Have you done "what you are supposed to do" today? Have you finished all your important tasks? 
11. MaintainedComposure (True/False) - Did you act in a way that represents who you wish to be?
12. PursuedGoals (True/False) - Have you progressed towards fulfilling your goals?
13. Studying (Numeric) - How many minutes have you spent today on learning something new?
14. Developing (Numeric) - How many minutes have you spent today on creating something new
15. Cardio (Numeric) - How many minutes have you dedicated today for cardio?
16. Workout (Numeric) - How many minutes have you dedicated today for power workouts
17. **Sleep** (hours + mins) - how long have you slept that day

We are not super-humans, no one is expected to accomplish everything every day, but it does help us notice trends and keeps us accountable of our behavior.

As an advanced version, I convert these inputs into numerical metrics and track them across time. The idea originated from Brandon Sanderson's "Metalmind" concept, where in every moment we are either developing and charging ourselves like a battery, or using our reserves (depleting the battery) when times are difficult. For example, working out is an investment in the moment, but we get it back when we have easier time moving our bodies. If we don't exercise for a long time, we won't have any "reserves" left to enjoy this physical fitness. 

Let me know if such a template is of interest to you.

The template also includes a section of logs - events that are special, that represent the expression of your values in your day to day lives. For example, my logs are:
1. **Insights** - Things I've learned about myself. Mindsets/habits/actions you should embrace.
2. **Achieved** - Whatever you define as success - It could be as small as finishing a book, and as big as getting a medal. 
3. **Initiated** - New systems/habits that improved your life, like starting to work out or reading books
4. **Enriched** - Content written, notes created/expanded, thoughts emerged.
5. Overcame - Challenges/failures, either internal or external that you faced and how you overcame them
6. **Connection** - Moments of connection with others, from pure happiness, to more intense feelings, deep moments of connection.
7. **Empowerment** - actions made with others in mind, for their wellbeing even at personal cost, such as acts of kindness to your partner, being a good friend/family member, etc. reaching to others from genuine intent and care.
8. **Affirmations** - expressions of self confidence, love and compassion. Things you want to remind yourself, especially today.

These events resurface using the bases plugin at the monthly level.

## Weekly

While on the day-to-day we might fluctuate, some days will be better, some worse, on some we are just too busy, on others we might have a few minutes to spare. Our hope is that on a weekly basis we are able to be on track with our plans. 

That is why we track our progress both as free-text, and check the tasks we have completed or overdue this week.

Also, we can look back across this week's days and see if there is a pattern we should be concerned about. For example if we weren't grateful for anything this week, than we should be more mindful of that. Similarly if we didn't get enough sleep, if we didn't exercise at all, etc. 

## Monthly

We are sometimes so busy on the day-to-day that it's easy to forget the bigger picture. The monthly review is all about the major events in our lives. 

Since focusing on tasks is more a quartelry-weekly thing, each month we focus only on our experiences. What was the peak, low event of the month? Which moment was impactful? Have we discovered anything new? Is there an opportunity for a beneficial change?

## Quarterly

On a quarterly basis, we can look back and see how much our lives have changed. We can see how we have developed personally, socially and professionally. 

Also, since we follow the 12 week year, the quarterly plan should be finished by the end of the quarter. Here we can track our progress on the plan, see if needs any modification.

## Yearly

The yearly review is all about reflecting on our identity. What are our core values? How have we manifested them throughout the passing year?

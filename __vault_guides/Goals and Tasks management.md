# Goals and task management

We all have our goals in life, and perhaps we have even started a few projects to advance in those goals. Obsidian can offer us a system to create, track and adapt these projects over time to make sure we are progressing towards our goals.

## Which tasks belong here

I believe that there are better task management tools than Obsidian. Mainly because most other tools such as Todoist, TickTick, Omnifocus have automatic sync across platforms and comfortable widgets and UI.

That's why simple tasks as "call the doctor" or "take out the trash" belong there. It would make your life so much easier to stick with these tools for your day to day tasks and productivity. However, some tasks can be better managed through Obsidian.

In my opinion, any task that is related to a project that has to be done on the computer, such as writing, researching, being an entrepreneur, can be done in obsidian. Tasks that require a computer don't need to be displayed on your phone because you are going to be on your computer while doing them anyway, and perhaps it is better not to overflow your regular todo list with all the project related tasks.

The combination of connecting your tasks into other notes, and the unlimited functionality of Obsidian tasks makes it a great project manager tool. 

## From values to actions

This system creates a smooth flow between our high level goals and our day to day lives through this pipeline:
1. **Core principles -> visions**: The importance of values relies on how we manifest them in our lives. While a value is a perfect abstract notion, like "equality", we need a more tangible way to measure them. This is where "visions" come in. For each value, we create a vision. A vision can satisfy multiply values, and it is even recommended. A vision is a translation of value into a goal, for example "equality" can translate into "becoming a political activist"
2. **Visions -> Projects**: Visions are then broken down into projects, which represents constant efforts towards accomplishing the goal. For example, a project can be "creating a political party". A project usually takes a year or more, but it can also be something constant without a due date. A vision can include multiple projects.
3. **Projects -> Quarterly plans**: A quarterly plan is when we break down the project into high level steps that can be accomplished in a quarter. For example, "Reaching 1000 signatures".
4. **Quarterly Plans -> Weekly Targets**: Each quarter plan is broken into 12 weeks, each including the smallest of steps needed to reach the quarterly target. For example "call 10 people" or "Prepare a cold email template". The 13th week of every quarter is reserved for catch ups in case some tasks are overdue. 
5. **Weekly Targets -> Daily Actions**: In our weekly review, we can decide on which day we will perform the tasks scheduled for that week.

This framework is loosely based on the [[12 week year (book)]] model, with the added benefit of smart linking, automation and digitization for convenience and usability. 

The task management pipeline is deeply integrated with the [[Periodical Journaling]] such that the relevant tasks will always resurface where and when you need them to.

I would recommend going over the Tasks plugin [Documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) to understand how to create, edit and use tasks based on your preferences with ease.

## Status management

Each part of the workflow (vision/project/quarterly plan) has a "status field" with the following values:
1. Backlog - Things that we want to do "someday", ideas on the back burner
2. Todo - Things that we plan on completing 
3. InProgress - Things that we have started working on
4. Completed - Goal achieved, no more open tasks
5. Maybe - Things that were in progress and were stopped, perhaps to be continued someday
6. Rejected - Things that are no longer relevant and will not be worked on

Note that some notes contains queries that reference this "status" field, for example filtering only for those with status "InProgress".

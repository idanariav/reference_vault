# Idea Processing

## When to create a new note  
  
My rule of thumb is to create a new note when at least three sources reference it. For example, while reading a book you encounter the concept of agency, so you create a link to it like so - [[agency]]. Then, in a different article/podcast, you see this topic coming up again and again, so you decide to link to it as well.  
  
Often, once an idea crosses the *attention threshold*, we begin to see it everyone, so the time it takes from the first to the third link is usually short.  
  
The reason I wait until I have at least 3 references is because by then I believe I have enough background or understanding to write at least one paragraph on the idea, meaning that I have managed to distill the core idea from the various contexts I first encountered it in. Another reason is that by waiting we create a new note that is already connected to other ideas, instead of starting from scratch (more on that later).  
  
However, feel free to create notes as you see fit, after all the idea of a second mind is that this is a living system, notes are constantly updated and changed with time, and nothing is permanent.  
## How to create a new note  
  
Creating a new note is as easy as it gets. You can either press the link to that new note, or type the name of the note in the *quick switcher* (which will suggest that note's name once you start typing it).  
  
If you have the *note_picker_template* set up, simply click on the "note" option when it pops up, and it will automatically add the note template and put it in the relevant folder (see more in [[Utils and Templates guide]]). Otherwise, a new empty note will be created in the root folder.  
  
## How to write a new note  
  
As a best practice, a note should be [[Atomism]], meaning that each note represents exactly one core idea. It is about distilling the essence of the idea from the different contexts in which you heard about it, and focusing on the idea itself. For example, the concept of "proactiveness" might be relevant in your work, your hobbies, and in finding meaning in life, but in essence, they all use the same idea - to take matters into your own hands, to be active and expressive, instead of passive and a slave to defaults.  
  
Atomism also makes it easier to connect the idea to other notes, because the more context or complexity that we add to an idea, the less common it will be. For example, if instead of "proactiveness" we called it "Being proactive about your day-to-day profession", it would be less relevant for being proactive in your personal life.  
  
## Connecting to other notes  
  
A note is only good as it's connections to other notes. A well-written note is irrelevant if it will never resurface while exploring other notes. Especially as the vault gets bigger with more and more notes, finding a specific one will become harder.  
  
That's why another rule of thumb I use is to make sure any new note is connected to at least three other notes. Usually one of them is a "Topic" note (or a moc). A more difficult version is to make sure that the note is linked to different notes from those who link to it, thus creating a flow of ideas from one to the next, instead of circular thinking. For example, a note that is linked by three other notes, and links back to those same three notes, has only three connections in total, while linking to three other notes means that it has six connections in total, doubling its importance.  
  
## Misc  
  
### Note vs moc  
  
When should a note become an MOC?  
There's no clear-cut answer to this question. [[Nick Milo]] talks about a *mental squeeze*, when a note tries to capture more branching ideas than it should.  
I think a note should become an MOC once we realize that combining all the different contexts the note is mentioned in a single place breaks the concept of atomism. When we notice we have made the idea too simple, and too abstract that it fits too many cases, and if we think a bit deeper, we can see that these cases reference different versions of the same idea.  
  
In those cases, it is best to turn the note from a regular note to a MOC, a map of content that presents a discussion between ideas that belong to the same topic, instead of a single individual idea. For example "knowledge management" is a MOC and not a regular note, because there are too many distinct ideas under the umbrella of knowledge management.  
  
After turning a note into an MOC, remember to create new notes for the distinct ideas that were smashed together in the previous note, and update the links to the new notes instead.  
  
### Statement vs concept  
  
When we capture a new idea, do we want to phrase it as a statement or as a concept? For example, we can come across several resources that mention how volunteering makes us happy. Do we wish to link it to a note named *happiness* or *helping others bring joy*? Both overlap yet not fully.  
  
On the surface, using a concept seems more fitting for an MOC than a separate note, but it depends on the context. The goal is to capture an idea that could be relevant to other cases. While "happiness" might seem too general and will probably be linked to other ideas about happiness that are unrelated to our connections with others, we also don't want to use "volunteering with those less fortunate gives us joy", but rather as something more general as I have suggested earlier - "helping others bring joy".  
  
There is no right answer, it depends on the case and your preferences, but do keep it in mind while converting ideas to notes.  
  
### Utils for better connectivity  
  
Seeing when we should create a note for an idea, or which notes it should be connected to, you can use:  
1. **Smart connections plugin** - it uses an AI model to suggest similarities between notes, which could inspire new connections that we didn't think about.  
2. **Strange new world plugin** - It provides a useful interface to see where and how notes are references, and how many references each note has (including uncreated notes)  
3. **Dataview queries** - in my home dashboard, I have several Dataview queries that show me whether there are notes that need work - such as those with fewer than 3 incoming/outgoing links.  
  
### Notes as drawings  
  
A picture is worth a thousand words. While visual thinking is a topic too large to discuss here, I will briefly focus on my workflow with visual notes and why I chose it. I believe that pictures can't replace text, but they could serve as a good cue for memorizing it. Meaning that having a visual note should accompany a textual note, and focus only on the main ideas that will help you remember the note itself, and not serve as "Whole book on a page". It is very difficult to have nuanced complex ideas in a simple drawing, but it could remind us of it.  
  
That is why I create a drawing for all books (which I rate above a 3), and all notes with at least 5 incoming links. I embed the drawing in the note itself, so you could see the visual version while reading the text.  
  
The advantage of the excalidraw plugin is that it shows by default the drawing when hovering over a note's name, so if you see a link and wonder what it's about, it is much easier to quickly look at the drawing through the preview mode, than to go inside it and read all the text.

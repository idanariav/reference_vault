# Obsidian and PKM in general

## What is PKM

PKM means Personal Knowledge Management, and it's all about preserving, connecting and utilizing information. We access more information in an hour than our brain will ever be able to process. We could no longer keep up and that's why we have (in addition to other things) to export some of our thinking into digital systems that don't forget.

Transferring knowledge into a system that "always remembers" helps us focus on what matters, on thinking, distilling and engaging with ideas, and/or using that information precisely when we need to. Energy is no longer spent on remembering, only thinking, reflecting and acting. 

For example, we might read a book, we might even highlight a couple of key phrases of that book, but how much of that book you remember 6 months after? How do the core ideas of the book relate to ideas from different books? It is only natural that we forget over time, and the complexity of the idea that the book tried to convey to us diminishes quickly. If, however, we make notes while reading, the ideas stays fresh forever.

## What is Obsidian

Obsidian functions much like Wikipedia, where we can link between different notes using "[[]]", which makes every note powerful not just because of it's own content but also due to it's connections to others.

What makes obsidian unique as opposed to other knowledge management tools such as Evernote and notion is:
1. **Future proof** - Whatever you create in obsidian is saved locally on your computer, which means you will never be locked out of it, and transferring it to a different software or even accessing it in case obsidian gets destroyed is simple and easy because it uses markdown files which are standard text files. Imagine notion suddenly going bankrupt and all the knowledge you gathered throughout the years is suddenly locked and gone forever, how awful would that be. 
2. **Privacy first** - No one can access your notes (unless you want them to), it's saved locally so it is as secure as it gets
3. **Open source community** - Thousands of members can contribute to Obsidian by creating community plugins which adds game changing features to obsidian (see [[Recommended Plugins]])
4. **Endless flexability** - Obsidian can be as simple or as complex as you want it to. It can be just a "word processor", or a sophisticated task manager/ai note taking system that is tailor made for you. Whatever you want it to be, you can create it.

# Vault Structure

This vault's structure is inspired by Nick Milo's [Access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0zWJ-TLghw&t=588s&ab_channel=LinkingYourThinkingwithNickMilo) system with some minor tweaking. 

The goal is to have a structure that is both easily searchable and organized, and yet flexible enough that it could grow with time and won't force a certain hierarchical order. 

1. **Areas** - This is where all your personal interests go to. This could be folder about hobbies, managing your household, general information that you want to store for future reference. 
2. **Calendar** - This is where you keep all the periodical notes - daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly (or any other frequency you use)
3. **Content** - A place for all your original thoughts and ideas, words that originate from your mind.
4. **Extras** - A more technical folder, for things such as templates, images, and other resources your vault needs
5. **System** - a place to manage your tasks and goals

You can see in each folder examples for a folder structure (which I use) and several example notes.

# Medium Independent

## Notes

This is a feature which results from the difference between (Related:: [[form vs essence]]). To be medium independent means that the core message, utility, or function of that thing is mostly unrelated to the medium by which it is passed on.
For example, I can learn about physics from reading a book, hearing a podcast, learning from a tutor, etc. Therefore knowledge is somewhat medium independent.

This is not limited to abstract or a-material things. I can get my nutrition through capsules, regular meals, or by injections. True, in most cases we are still highly dependent on eating for nutrition, but that is a fixation on a specific medium, not to say that this need - nutrition is not medium independent.

The more we are able to detect and isolate our needs and desires into it's core essence, and discover which functions are medium independent, the more benefits we could bring to humanity. For example, (Jump:: [[digitization]]) has brought massive improvement to our ability to communicate, share knowledge, and trade in vast amounts since we altered the physical medium with the digital one.

When we focus on ideas, it's clear to see how they are medium independent. They function as sealed containers of creativity, able to be implemented in different topics, fields and situations.
However, in order to make them truly independent, the have to be (Jump:: [[Atomism|atomic]]), because only the pure, core idea is what enables it to be transferrable (Aka:: [[Transferred Learning]]), otherwise it will carry redundant context that will prevent it from being useful.

This is similar to the programming concept of (Related:: [[SOLID principle]]), which states that each function should only have one goal.

# P.A.R.A method

## Notes

PARA is another possible method of organizing a knowledge system. (Opposes:: [[access method]])

1. P - **Projects**: things that are active, usually have a due date and will advance you in your life. Knowledge that is specific to the project and not anywhere else can be saved here.
2. A - **Areas**: areas of interest/relevance to your life. things that are "unending", such as music, personal finance, books, etc.
3. R - **Resources**: bits of knowledge you collect from various sources. could be connected to areas and or projects. A useful way of storing information can be found at (Jump:: [[methods of knowledge management]])
4. A - **Archives**, instead of deleting a resource/project, archive it in case you would want to retrieve it later

# The STIR system

## Notes

similar to (Jump:: [[The LATCH system]]), this is another way of organizing your notes in a way to find and use them with ease:

1. **S - Space**: (similar to "location") are these notes relates to a specific location, where have you taken them?
2. **T - Time:** timestamp your notes so that by remember when you worked on something you could locate it.
3. **I - Importance:** [[context]] driven, how useful this note is in this specific use case/situation?
4. **R - Relevance:** how connected this note is to your specific situation/ use case?

my opinion - I think that this attempt to "rebrand" an organizing system by Nick is definitely lacking. *LATCH is more clear in terms of how to use it,* and which type of data I should add to my notes. *While STIR gives me criteria to evaluate my notes* but not how to make it easier to search/find when needed.

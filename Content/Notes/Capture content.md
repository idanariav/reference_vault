# Capture Content

## Notes

we need to store/capture information in a way that it will be useful later on and easy to retrieve. it takes longer to make but its value is much greater. The "code" method is relevant to the "resource" component of (Jump:: [[P.A.R.A|PARA]]), but can be used in other knowledge management methods as well, and describes how should we work with the content we capture:

1. *C - Capture*: write your initial impression/summary of that bit of knowledge in an easy-to-write place. the availability of that capture method is key.
2. *O - Organize*: connect that bit of knowledge to the sections which are relevant, such as areas/projects or other resources
3. *D - Distill*: go over the resource again and mark the important parts, distill a summary/key take-away from it
4. *E - Express*: pass that distilled part forward through any method/media you wish so that knowledge would be used later on instead of rotting in a vault.

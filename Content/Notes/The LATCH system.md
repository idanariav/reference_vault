# The LATCH system

## Notes

5 ways of organizing your pkm, or your notes, according to the LATCH system. each one of the letters represents a useful metadata that will help you remember, search and find the relevant information when you need it.

1. **L - Location**: are these notes relates to a specific location, where have you taken them?
2. **A - Alphabet**: name the note in a rememberable way, use aliases, perhaps a suffix or a prefix, for example - "university classes".
3. **T - Time:** timestamp your notes so that by remember when you worked on something you could locate it.
4. **C - Category:** to which category this note belongs to? by linking it to a category it will be easier to find if all you remember is the topic and not the note itself.
5. **H - Hierarchy:** - is this note a child/sibling of a different note? by creating a "family tree" for notes it will be easier to discover related notes.

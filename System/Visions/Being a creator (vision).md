# Being a creator

## Key result (what I'm trying to achieve)
To have online presence, to have a platform where I can share, discuss and enrich my knowledge with others. 

## Why this goal?
I want my knowledge, and my routine, to have meaning. It can only be done if it is put into use, if it goes beyond the limits of my own mind and expand into the mind of others, perhaps helping them overcome challenges more easily, perhaps it can solve problems that were unsolvable before, or even just capture their interest for a short while. 

## How can I reach this goal? (active projects)

```dataview
TABLE StartDate, EndDate, Status FROM #System/Project AND [[Being a creator (vision)]]
SORT StartDate
```

# Creativity (value)


## Moto
Moto:: ðŸŽ¨ Create Value

## Why this principle
Creativity is to bring something new to the world, and to do so requires not only action, but the discovery of the self. This is a conscious effort of creating value for others, by synthesizing yourself into the world. Both an outward and inward facing action at the same time. 

I can read all the books in the world, hear all the podcast, but I will never be a true learner, or a useful person if i let all this knowledge go to waste. this knowledge needs to be used, to be acted upon, and needs to be enriched. when I practice my knowledge, i.e. create new connections between topics, I bring value and meaning to this knowledge, and by spreading it onwards, I bring value to others.

## How can I practice it
Expressing my mastery in a certain field. A measure of my creativity, the ability to use my knowledge to create something new, to see connections that only I can see due to my specific way of thinking, to merge and give birth to new ideas and pass it along to others, because knowledge is only useful when shared (and acted upon).

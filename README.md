Hello everyone and welcome!

This vault is both a chance to "look under the hood" and see how I manage my life and my knowledge using Obsidian as my second brain, while also giving you a starter vault ready to use with templates, guides and examples.

There are many potential uses for obsidian, and an even greater variety in preferences so I'm sure this vault won't be a "one size fits all". As with any other resources, take it apart, examine it, keep what you like, and discard or change everything else.

My vault use cases:
1. **Journaling** - I want to record my thoughts about the day, to reflect about my life, and to track my progress through time
2. **Goal settings and project management** - I have things I want to achieve in life, and this helps me with the planning, executing and measuring my progress
3. **Knowledge management** - I want to enrich my inner world, to digest ideas, to find connections between them, and see how my knowledge grows with time
4. **Content writing** - I use this as a writing and publishing platform
5. **Archives** - There are points of information that will become useful in the future and I don't want to forget/lose them

I remember how frustrating it might be to set up a new vault, so many things to consider and endless scrolling through youtube and discord channels to find the exact template that you need. So this is a good place to start without all that hassle.

The "vault_guides" folder is dedicated to help you familiarize yourself with the vault and it's components. Once you got the hang of it feel free to delete it or move it someplace else. 

Have fun!
